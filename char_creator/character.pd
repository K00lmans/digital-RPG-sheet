To pick this lineage agility cannot be one of your two lowest stats, and vice versa for fortitude. As this lineage you get the special ability to go into or out of your shell; for one action you can do so. When you are inside your shell, your movement is zero but you get a +5 to your protection score. You also gain training in fortitude.",

You can not pick this lineage if any of those stats is among your two lowest stats. Beshrewn resist chilling and depressing damage, while being weak to hearing and impaling damage. Beshrewn have two subraces, Beshrewn-Maffei and Beshrewn-Razione. Beshrewn-Maffei are humanoid mice who average about 4 feet tall, with large circular ears and who tend to form mafia-like social circles with other Beshrewn. Beshrewn-Maffeiâ€™s special ability is that they do not trigger reactions while an ally is next to them. Beshrewn-Razione are sentient mice or rats. Their special ability is that when training in a formation everyone gains double points and they skip the initial roll to learn a formation.",
